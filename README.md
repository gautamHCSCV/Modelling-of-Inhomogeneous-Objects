# Modelling-of-Inhomogeneous-Objects
Modelling viscoelastic deformable objects refers to the process of representing and simulating the behavior of materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic properties when subjected to external forces or deformations.

Viscoelastic materials are those that exhibit time-dependent behavior, meaning their response to deformation is influenced by both their elastic properties (ability to return to their original shape) and their viscous properties (ability to dissipate energy over time). The modelling of viscoelastic deformable objects typically involves creating a mathematical or computational model that captures the material's behavior accurately. 

By simulating the response of a viscoelastic object to external forces using such models, we can gain insights into its texture and roughness. The texture refers to the spatial arrangement and variation of surface features, while roughness describes the irregularities and fine-scale variations in the surface profile.
